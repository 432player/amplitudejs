### Overview ###
The concept of AmplitudeJS is simple, allow designers to fully control the look and feel of their audio player through the web without having to understand advanced scripting.
In HTML5, the audio tag allows users to add common audio formats to their web page.  The problem is that the audio playback interface is controlled by the browser.  AmplitudeJS
puts you in control of the designs by simply applying an ID or a class to page elements.  You can then style these elements through CSS and control your audio.  AmplitudeJS goes above
and beyond by adding playlist capabilities (next, previous, shuffle), dynamic song insertions, and song meta data.

### Amplitude Config ###
Previous versions of AmplitudeJS relyed on the programmer to add audio tags for each song. Now you don't have to even have an audio tag in your HTML
because everything is controlled through the AmplitudeJS config.
