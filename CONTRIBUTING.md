Thanks for your interest in contributing to the AmplitudeJS project! We have a few guidelines on getting started and how to contribute:

## Coding Guidelines

- Be friendly and respectful of other people's ideas
- Make sure all code is properly indented with tabs and commented thoroughly
- Everything MUST be in Vanilla JavaScript and not revolve around any library
- Spend some quality time testing your code

## Set Up Your Development Environment
1. Clone Github repository to your machine. Use the `dev` branch to access the latest and greatest code.
2. All source code is located in the `src` folder

## Creating a new build of `amplitude.js`
1. Change directories into where you cloned the repository and run `npm install`
2. Make your changes to the appropriate files in the `src` directory
3. Run `npm run build` to process a build of your source code
