# Getting Help

Come across a bug or an issue and need a hand? There are multiple ways to get help! 

## Open A GitHub Issue

First place to start if you are stuck is read the documentation. It is beautiful, simple, and straight to the point. The documentation answers 95% of people's questions. [View our documentation &rarr;](https://521dimensions.com/open-source/amplitudejs/docs)

Community support is available for free on our Github page. Because our community is based off of an entire volunteer basis, issues are responded to on a "best effort" basis. You'll get a response as soon as someone is available to answer your question.

Looking to open an issue with community support? [Open a new Github Issue &rarr;](https://github.com/521dimensions/amplitudejs/issues/new/choose). Before you start we will need to know your AmplitudeJS version. To find that, open the developer console in your browser and run `Amplitude.getVersion()`. This will give you your current AmplitudeJS version.

If you have a quick question, you can jump on our Gitter and see if anyone is available: [Ask a question on Gitter &rarr;](https://gitter.im/521dimensions/amplitudejs)
